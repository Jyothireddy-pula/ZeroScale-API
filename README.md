# ZeroScale-API

( ZeroScale-API ) - Scalable & Cost-Optimized Serverless Backend

ZeroScale-API is a scalable, serverless backend solution designed for efficiently managing profiles and reviews. Built using the Serverless Framework and deployed on AWS Lambda, it eliminates infrastructure management while ensuring cost-effective scaling and high availability.

💰 Cost Efficiency & Scalability



The API scales down to approximately zero cost for up to 1 million API requests per month.

If there is no traffic, the infrastructure automatically scales down to near-zero cost, inclusive of AWS services like S3, API Gateway, and other dependencies.

When traffic increases, it seamlessly scales up using the AWS API Gateway to handle the load.

After exceeding 1 million requests, costs are incurred based on AWS Lambda pricing.

🚀 Fully Automated & Cost-Optimized CI/CD Deployment

Run Code Quality Checks – ESLint for linting and Jest for API endpoint testing.

Automated CI/CD Based Testing & Deployment Optimization

Installs the testing dependencies, runs tests, and removes them post-testing to reduce package size.

Prunes old versions from the cloud and reduces dev dependencies before packaging.

Deploy to AWS – Automatically updates the AWS Lambda function and connects with API Gateway.

Verify and Activate Lambda – Ensures the function is running seamlessly after deployment.
